<p>Watch this 5 minute talk by Pam Selle</p>
<p>Few points worth sharing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are a business asset. You’re worth $X to your company. Your company knows the X… do you know the X?</li>
  <li>The more hours you work, the less money you’re making for your time.</li>
  <li>Do side projects. Maybe even side projects that make money.</li>
  <li>You only stay late because you can’t do your work. Do your work at work. Get off Facebook, make the shit you want to happen happen, and go the fuck home when you’re done.</li>
  <li>When you work overtime, your productivity goes down.</li>
  <li>Get a Life</li>
  <li>Be happy</li>
</ul>
<p>I copied and pasted the notes from <a href="https://swizec.com/blog/go-fuck-home/swizec/7139">Swizec Teller</a> website.</p>

<p>Stop reading this and go fucking watch the talk!</p>
