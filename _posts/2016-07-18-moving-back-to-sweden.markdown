It is time again to switch destination and seek new adventures, this time I'm returning back to Stockholm, house of the new unicorns.

I will miss a lot my family and friends, I will also miss the ocean and surfing.
I will not miss a whole bunch of stuff, that I hope it will get better when I return back to Morocco.
