Recently i had the pleasure to listen to Seth Godin recording where he guides thirty entrepreneurs through a workshop exploring how they can build and run their dream business.

This podcast is a great source of inspiration, here is Seth's welcome message:

In the summer of 2012, I had an amazing opportunity to spend three days with a group of extremely motivated entrepreneurs. People right at the beginning of building their project, launching their organization. During those three days, I took them on a guided tour of some of the questions they were going to have to wrestle with, some of the difficult places they were going to strand up and say "this is me, this is what I'm making".
