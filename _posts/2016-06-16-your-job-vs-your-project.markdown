An interesting article from Seth Godin on the importance of projects.

<blockquote>
<p>Jobs are finite, specified and something we 'get'. Doing a job makes us defensive, it limits our thinking. The goal is to do just enough, not get in trouble, meet spec. When in doubt, seek deniability.</p>

<p>Projects are open-ended, chosen and ours. Working on a project opens the door to possibility. Projects are about better, about new frontiers, about making change happen. When in doubt, dare.</p>

<p>Jobs demand meetings and the key word is 'later'. Projects encourage 'now.'</p>

<p>You can get paid for a job (or a project). Or not. The pay isn't the point, the approach is.</p>

<p>Some people don't have a project, only a job. That's a choice, and it's a shame. Some people work to turn their project into a job, getting them the worst of both. If all you've ever had is jobs (a habit that's encouraged starting in first grade), it's difficult to see just how easy it is to transform your work into a project.</p>

<p>Welcome to projectworld.</p>
