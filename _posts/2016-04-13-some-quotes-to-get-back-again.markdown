I took a break from blogging to work on the self, myself and I.
[Tim Ferris podcast](http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/) & [the unmistakable creative](https://unmistakablecreative.com/ ) have been a great source of inspiration, highly recommend to everyone.

The following quotes, caught my attention.

<em>Hope is not a strategy, luck is not a factor, failure is not an option - James Cameron</em>.

<em>Do you want to change your life faster trade your expectation for appreciation, you will have a whole new life - Tony Robbins</em>.

<em>What you know doesnâ€™t mean shit - Tony Robbins</em>.

Listen to [Tony Robbins on Morning Routines, Peak Performance, and Mastering Money](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/10/15/money-master-the-game/) interview with Tim Ferriss.
