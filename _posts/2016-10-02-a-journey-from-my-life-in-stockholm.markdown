<p>A lot of things has changed since I moved back to Morocco in 2009, life got so much expensive however I don't think the salaries increased that much.</p>

<p>Rent almost doubled, want to buy a house, go north of Sweden please, Mcdonald's menu almost doubled, credits are everywhere now even if you are looking to buy a pair of glasses.</p>

<p>Few years ago, I used to tell my friends that Stockholm is similar to Morocco, prices are almost the same in food, rent, etc; well not anymore guys!</p>
