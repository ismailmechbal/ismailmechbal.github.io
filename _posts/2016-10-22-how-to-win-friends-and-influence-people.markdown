<p>Don't judge the book by its cover, it is fascinatingly true; I always misjudged the book "How to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie" based only on the cover and also because the book is old.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a great book, no bullshitting and straight to the point, a book that focus on actions.</p>
<p>A must read!</p>
