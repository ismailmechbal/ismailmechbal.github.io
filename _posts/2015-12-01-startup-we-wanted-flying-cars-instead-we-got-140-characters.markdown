While reading [Elon Musk](http://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/0062301233) biography by Ashlee, a remarkable quote by Peter Thiel marked in my mind and i decided to share it with whoever is reading this post.

<blockquote>We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters</blockquote>

Founders Fund, where Peter Thiel is a co-founder has published an interesting manifesto of sorts, called [What Happened To The Future?](http://foundersfund.com/the-future)


Related to this subject, Peter Thiel book [Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804139296) is worth reading.
