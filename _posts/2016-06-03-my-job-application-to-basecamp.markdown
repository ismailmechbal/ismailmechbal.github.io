Today, 3rd June 2016, while listening to [Jason's podcast with Kevin Rose, The Journal](https://soundcloud.com/the-journal/jason-fried), I thought holy crap, why didn't I ever apply to Basecamp!

Everything happens for a reason, and the reason it is I will apply today.

Dear Mercedes,

Jason & David have been a great source of inspiration to me for more than 8 years. SVN, Getting Real, Rework & Work in progress have all helped me shape my views in design, product, programming and most importantly life.

I remember three years ago when I had to switch from PHP and choose between Python or Ruby, I chose the latter because of Ruby on Rails and 37signals philosophy.

I consider myself lucky, I have a constant desire to learn, I love keeping up to date with technology as well as reading and writing.

I've been introduced to web design since my early age, I'm 33 now, I developed my first website in 1998, a phishing website, not very proud of, thankfully it was just for fun and learning purpose.

In 2007, I had an opportunity to study a Master degree in Human Computer Interaction at Uppsala university, usability together with design principles that I learned from Ryan & Jason helped me understand what makes great products.

I can't count how many times I listened to [DHH talk at Startup School 08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CDXJ6bMkMY), it highly inspires me and motivates me whenever I'm working on a new product, which I tried several times and failed proudly; I'm more than confident now that a great team and a great execution is key to success, however I also learned that life is also about giving, thank you for Ruby on Rails and please contemplate on this quote:

<em><strong>What most people need to learn in life is how to love people and use things instead of using people and loving things.</strong></em>.

My satisfaction doesn't come by excelling at one skill, I prefer to learn and use as many skills as I can by applying the 80/20 rule, therefore you might find me either UX'ing, coding, blogging, marketing, cooking, supporting customers, selling, mentoring or even surfing :)

In 2012, I launched [Unik](http://www.unik.ma), a web agency where we had the pleasure to work with amazing clients from all around the world, recently I launched [Werunik](https://werunik.com?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=basecamp_marketing_designer_job), a <strong>"Fucking web development agency"</strong> as I like to call it.

During my free time, I love sharing some stories, ideas, technical tips on my personal blog, [sboura.com](http://sboura.com/resume?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=basecamp_marketing_designer_job)

I also started teaching web design to Sakina, my 8 years old daughter, here is a sample of what we've been baking:

Finally, I'm looking forward having my name and illustration on
https://basecamp.com/about/team

You can find my resume on the following link:

Psst: I have two secrets:

1. I published this job application to my personal blog, on this link.
2. I use Nylas N1, an open source email client, I highly recommend it to keep track of email opens and clicks, by which I will take further actions based on your interaction with this email :)
