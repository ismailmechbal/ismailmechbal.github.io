In the age of endless distraction, I find myself regularly ashamed of how I communicate with others, Celeste Headlee gave a great TED Talk on better conversation, definitely worth it, below a summary of the talk:

1. Don't multitask

2. Don't pontificate. If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth, write a blog

3. Use open-ended questions. In this case, take a cue from journalists. Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how.

4. Go with the flow. That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind

5. If you don't know, say that you don't know

6. Don't equate your experience with theirs. If they're talking about having lost a family member, don't start talking about the time you lost a family member.

7. Try not to repeat yourself

8. Stay out of the weeds. Frankly, people don't care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details that you're struggling to come up with in your mind.

9. Listen (post link to tim interview with the known interviewer)
Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. He said, "Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand. We listen with the intent to reply."
"If your mouth is open, you're not learning." And Calvin Coolidge said, "No man ever listened his way out of a job."

10. Be brief. A good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject. -- Winston Churchill
