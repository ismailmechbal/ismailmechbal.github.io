<p>If you've never heard of A. J. Jacobs, go check out his articles at Esquire, the kind of writing style I love and that keeps me entertained.</p>

<p>It was 23.30, I planned to go sleep when I opened an article shared by Tim Ferriss on Linkedin, Man! I should not have clicked!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a26792/honesty0707/?utm_source=sboura_com">I Think You're Fat</a>, a hilarious article about Brad Blanton mostly known for his radical honestly mouvement, whenever I read a hilarious paragraph I had to share it with my buddies, here is some interesting ones.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No topic is off-limits. "I've slept with more than five hundred women and about a half dozen men," he tells me. "I've had a whole bunch of threesomes" -- one of which involved a hermaphrodite prostitute equipped with dual organs.</p>
<p>What about animals?</p>
<p>Blanton thinks for a minute. "I let my dog lick my dick once."</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>One other thing is also becoming apparent: There's a fine line between radical honesty and creepiness. Or actually no line at all. It's simple logic: Men think about sex every three minutes, as the scientists at Redbook remind us. If you speak whatever's on your mind, you'll be talking about sex every three minutes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a business breakfast with an editor from Rachael Ray's magazine. As we're sitting together, I tell her that I remember what she wore the first time we met -- a black shirt that revealed her shoulders in a provocative way. I say that I'd try to sleep with her if I were single. I confess to her that I just attempted (unsuccessfully) to look down her shirt during breakfast.</p>

<p>There you go, you got a taste of what this article looks like, you might find it a bit tense and perverting, however you know what?</p>
<p>I don't really give a shit about what you think!</p>
