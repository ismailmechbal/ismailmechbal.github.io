<p>I planned on writing this article when Kelly Slater scored a great 10 during the third heat at Billabong's competition, what I didn't know at that time was how the heck can he won the competition.</p>

<p>At the age of 44, Kelly did an amazing job by winning the Billabong's against the actual number 1, John John Florence, what a lesson on grit, passion and perseverence.
