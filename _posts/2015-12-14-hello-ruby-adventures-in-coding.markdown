I recently came across an interesting book called "Hello Ruby: Adventures in Coding" by Linda Liukas (founder of Rails Girls), i just ordered the Swedish version for my daughter who will be extremely happy reading it together with me!

The book introduces programming concepts without requiring a computer at all, using Ruby, the main character, a small girl with a huge imagination, and the determination to solve any puzzle.

Let see how it goes after reading this book, and probably will write a review about it.
