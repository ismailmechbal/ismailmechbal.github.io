Dear fellow citizen,

I'll make you sure you're well entertained watching your idols show while netflix chilling.

I'll promise you a longer working hours in a more shittier jobs.

I'll realize your dream and lets you work long enough until your grandgrand kid becomes your manager.

I'll fight to make your retirement pension vanish the day you go collect it.

When that day comes, I'll laugh the shit out of you and everyone who elected me as Mr president.
