<p>Dear fellow citizen,</p>

<p>I'll make you sure you're well entertained watching your idols show while netflix chilling.</p>

<p>I'll promise you a longer working hours in a more shittier jobs.</p>

<p>I'll realize your dream and lets you work long enough until your grandgrand kid becomes your manager.</p>

<p>I'll fight to make your retirement pension vanish the day you go collect it.</p>

<p>When that day comes, I'll laugh the shit out of you and everyone who elected me as Mr president.</p>
