<p>While sitting at Espresso house coffee, I couldn't resist to write about a pattern that I see again and again which is the working situation of our fellow immigrants.</p>

<p>First, I don't like the word "immigrant", a more suitable word is "Transnationalism". However if we want to acknowledge the word "Immigrant" then yes indeed we're all immigrant.</p>

<p>Who is cleaning the streets in the freeezing winter? A swede? No Effin way!</p>

<p>I understand that many are not well educated, however education is something you acquire very easily if, of course, there is a willingness from the system; you don't need an education to have a logical thinking or more importantly to acquire social skills.</p>
<p>Almost anyone can accomplish some tasks that requires a minimum of training such as checking emails, planning, social media etc.</p>
