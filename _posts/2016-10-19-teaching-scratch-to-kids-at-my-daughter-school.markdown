<p>Today, I introduced the kids at my daughter school "Futura skolan" to Scratch.</p>

<p>My impression is that the kids loved Scratch and were excited to learn more about it!</p>

<p>I got some interesting feedback from the kids, one said that it is fun to be a programmer, I said yes indeed, you can have the luxury to work remotely from anyhwere you want!</p>
