title: "Kelly's 14 Rules applied to software engineering"
date: 2016-06-08

I just learned about Kelly Johnson, and how he disrupted the military aviation industry with 14 simple rules, I copied some of these rules that can be applied to software engineering.

#### The number of people having any connection with the project must be restricted in an almost vicious manner. Use a small number of good people (10% to 25% compared to the so-called normal systems)

#### A very simple drawing and drawing release system with great flexibility for making changes must be provided.

#### There must be a minimum number of reports required, but important work must be recorded thoroughly.

I highly recommend watching this Keynote from Nicolas, where I learned about Kelly's rules.
