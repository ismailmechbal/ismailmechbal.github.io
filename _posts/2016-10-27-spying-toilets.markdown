You are unemployed, one night you were invited to a gala with luxury delicatesse's or like me you sneaked out to a meetup mostly because of the free food it offers, later that evening you had an amazing poo!

Next morning, a governement representative official kicks in at your house and keep asking you questions how you manage your life.

You're wondering what going on, using your social engineering skills you get from this guy the reason for his visit, it is actually that madafaka toilet that they recently installed, I knew it, it is so comfy that you can't even leave it!

Well that toilet does actually analyze your poo, extract key ingredients you've eaten and send it to the governement to identify what you've eaten.

This guy also told me that the smell goes attached as well, however he asked to keep it a secret.

TRUE STORY!
