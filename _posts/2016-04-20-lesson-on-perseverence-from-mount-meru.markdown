A great lesson on perseverence and resilience can be learned from the extreme sport documentary "Meru", back in 2008, three elite climbers Conrad Anker, Jimmy Chin and Renan Ozturk attempted their first ascent of the precarious Shark’s Fin route on Mount Meru, in the Indian Himalayas, due to the high risk of losing fingers and toes, if not their lives, the team decided to give up just a few hundred feet from the summit.

In 2011, they went back to the Shark’s Fin on Mount Meru for a new attempt, this time with some important lessons learned, they made it.
