        <title>Teaching scratch to kids at my daughter school</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I introduced the kids at my daughter school &quot;Futura skolan&quot; to Scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My impression is that the kids loved Scratch and were excited to learn more about it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got some interesting feedback from the kids, one said that it is fun to be a programmer, I said yes indeed, you can have the luxury to work remotely from anyhwere you want!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Notes from my life in Stockholm - Expensive life</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of things has changed since I moved back to Morocco in 2009, life got so much expensive however I don&#39;t think the salaries increased that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rent almost doubled, want to buy a house, go north of Sweden please, Mcdonald&#39;s menu almost doubled, credits are everywhere now even if you are looking to buy a pair of glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few years ago, I used to tell my friends that Stockholm is similar to Morocco, prices are almost the same in food, rent, etc; well not anymore guys!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lessons on passion from Kelly Slater Heat score at Billabong Pro Tahiti</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I planned on writing this article when Kelly Slater scored a great 10 during the third heat at Billabong&#39;s competition, what I didn&#39;t know at that time was how the heck can he won the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the age of 44, Kelly did an amazing job by winning the Billabong&#39;s against the actual number 1, John John Florence, what a lesson on grit, passion and perseverence.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Maybe the best programmers aren&#39;t those who spectacularly solve crazy problems, but those who don&#39;t create them, which is much more silent. - Lena Herrmann

        <title>Don&#39;t add your 2 cents</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2016/07/dont-add-your-2-cents.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Don&#39;t add your 2 cents&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derek Sivers nailed it when his friend Simone asked him for a non-obvious advice on management, his only advice &lt;strong&gt;Don’t add your two cents to their ideas&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derek explains it better here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it plays out at work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;employee:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been working for the past two weeks on this new design. What do you think?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;boss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I like it! Really good. Maybe just a darker shade of blue there, and change the word ‘giant’ to ‘huge’. Other than that, it’s great!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, because the boss said so, the creator of that design will have to change it just a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of that small change, that person no longer feels full ownership of their project. (Then you wonder why they’re not motivated!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Imagine this instead:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;employee:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been working for the past two weeks on this new design. What do you think?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;boss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s perfect. Great work!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This slight change made a huge difference in the psychology of motivation. Now that person can feel full ownership of this project, which is more likely to lead to more involvement and commitment for future projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boss’s opinion is no better than anyone else’s. But once you become the boss, unfortunately your opinion is dangerous because it’s not just one person’s opinion anymore — it’s a command! So adding your two cents can really hurt morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A business should not focus on the boss, so this restraint is healthy. You shouldn’t give your opinion on everything just because you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, if there’s more than “2 cents” worth of stuff that needs to change, then this rule does not apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if your contribution is small and probably just a meaningless opinion, just let it go. Let the other person feel full ownership of the idea, instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sivers.org/2c?utm_source=sboura&quot;&gt;2cents article link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;I decided to post my kids creativity objects, whether a painting, drawing ... as banners for my shitty articles; they are the number one fuel for my creativity!&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>10 ways to have a better conversation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2016/07/care-about-others.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;10 ways to have a better conversation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the age of endless distraction, I find myself regularly ashamed of how I communicate with others, Celeste Headlee gave a great TED Talk on better conversation, definitely worth it, below a summary of the talk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t multitask&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t pontificate. If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth, write a blog&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use open-ended questions. In this case, take a cue from journalists. Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go with the flow. That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don’t know, say that you don’t know&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t equate your experience with theirs. If they’re talking about having lost a family member, don’t start talking about the time you lost a family member.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try not to repeat yourself&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay out of the weeds. Frankly, people don’t care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details that you’re struggling to come up with in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Listen (post link to tim interview with the known interviewer)
Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. He said, “Most of us don’t listen with the intent to understand. We listen with the intent to reply.”
“If your mouth is open, you’re not learning.” And Calvin Coolidge said, “No man ever listened his way out of a job.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be brief. A good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject. – Winston Churchill&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Is the glass half full or half empty?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2016/07/is-the-glass-half-full-or-half-empty.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Is the glass half full or half empty?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed reading this short post from Seth Godin on optimism&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the glass half full or half empty?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pessimist sees what&#39;s present today and can only imagine eventual decline. The glass is already half empty and it&#39;s only going to get worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The optimist understands that there&#39;s a difference between today and tomorrow. The glass is half full, with room for more. The vision is based on possibility, the future tense, not the present one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pessimists have trouble making room for possibility, and thus possibility has trouble finding room for pessimists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as we realize that there is a difference between right now and what might happen next, we can move ourselves to the posture of possibility, to the self-fulfilling engine of optimism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Moving back to Sweden</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2016/07/stockholm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Moving back to Sweden&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is time again to switch destination and seek new adventures, this time I’m returning back to Stockholm, house of the new unicorns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will miss a lot my family and friends, I will also miss the ocean and surfing.
I will not miss a whole bunch of stuff, that I hope it will get better when I return back to Morocco.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nobody wants to read your sh*t</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2016/06/nobody-wants-to-read-your-shit.png&quot; alt=&quot;Nobody wants to read your shit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobody wants to read your shit&lt;/strong&gt;, a book I highly recommend for marketers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A snapshot from Chapter 4:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you understand that nobody wants to read your shit, your mind becomes powerfully concentrated. You realize that writing/reading is, above all, a transaction. The reader donates her time and attention, which are extremely valuable commodities. In return, you the writer must give her something worthy of her gift to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you understand that nobody wants to read your shit, you develop empathy. You acquire the skill that is indispensable to all artists and entrepreneurs—the ability to switch back and forth in your imagination from your own point of view as writer/painter/seller to the point of view of your reader/gallery-goer/customer. You learn to ask yourself with every phrase and every sentence: Is this interesting? Is it fun or challenging or inventive? Am I giving the reader enough? Is he bored? Is he following where I want to lead him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.blackirishbooks.com/pages/nobody-wants-to-read-your-sh-t-download&quot;&gt;Download the book while for FREE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
