&lt;p&gt;This podcast is a great source of inspiration, here is Seth’s welcome message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2012, I had an amazing opportunity to spend three days with a group of extremely motivated entrepreneurs. People right at the beginning of building their project, launching their organization. During those three days, I took them on a guided tour of some of the questions they were going to have to wrestle with, some of the difficult places they were going to strand up and say “this is me, this is what I’m making”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you go, the links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/&quot;&gt;Jacob Nielsen&lt;/a&gt; answer the question, here is an excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;
The Web is not an application environment, and it usually doesn’t have dialog boxes. Instead, the Web is a navigation environment where users move between pages of information. Since hypertext navigation is the dominant user behavior, users have learned to rely on the Back button for getting out of unpleasant situations. Whenever users arrive at pages they don’t want, they slam their mouse directly onto the Back button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Back is such a strong behavior on the Web, it is usually not necessary to offer explicit Cancel buttons. If the user asks for something but doesn’t want it, then you can be sure that it’s Back button time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offer a Cancel button when users may fear that they have committed to something they want to avoid. Having an explicit way to Cancel provides an extra feeling of safety that is not afforded by simply leaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancel is mainly useful for multi-step dialogs where the user has progressed past one or more pages with actions. At this time, pressing the Back button will not undo these actions and it would be better if the user would click Cancel.
&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
